Hi stranger :wave:

I am Jose Fernando Barrera De Plaza, holding a master's degree in Economics with a specialization in Computational Mathematics. My academic pursuits revolve around a data-driven approach aimed at quantifying and elucidating phenomena through modeling and empirical research. I possess a robust programming background, proficient in diverse languages and software applications such as Python, Java, Stata, SQL, R, and Excel (including VBA Macros). Moreover, I have acquired proficiency in various visualization and storytelling tools such as Beamer in LaTeX, Business Intelligence (BI) platforms, and Looker Studio.

Currently, I am actively engaged in interdisciplinary research encompassing social sciences and computational domains. My professional experience spans working with prominent international organizations like the World Bank, the International Migration Organization (IMO), as well as collaborating with multiple governments. In these roles, I have successfully employed cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) models based on word embeddings and language transformers to identify and address online hate speech.

As a skilled programmer, I have had the opportunity to develop API resources at an industry-level, constructing and maintaining well-documented API REST endpoints for clients using tools like Swagger IO. Additionally, I have extensive experience in designing and managing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, leveraging SQL to integrate DataLake resources into cohesive and comprehensive tables.

My research interests currently are convex linear combinations across various disciplines, including but not limited to Computer Science, Data Science, Economics, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Data Analysis, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
