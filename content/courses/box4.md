- __Introduction to Deep Learning, 2020. HSE University.__
Build and test models using Tensorflow including but not limited to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Learning, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This modelling were pack with theorical and practical content to fully understand the mathematical and empirical concepts for each type of model. We also had the chance to apply this knowledge on image classification and entity recognition.

- __Natural Language Processing, 2020. HSE University.__
Tools and pipelines fully applied on Deep Learning, Topic Modelling, Supervised and unsupervised learning, sentiment analysis, text processing and various models relevant in NLP research. As a project, we developed a Chatterbot that can mantain a conversation based on text messaging and client service. We used Tensorflow as an innovative and research playground for the projects and activities.
