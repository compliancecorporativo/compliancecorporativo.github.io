This document explores the heterogeneities in compliance with the isolation measures within
the municipalities of Colombia that were treated with Ingreso Solidario program implemented as an unconditional transfer given to poor individuals to face the economic and health
emergency caused by Covid-19. Using local mobility data, the announcement of payment of
Ingreso Solidario, and effective treatment of the program, a differences-in-differences methodology was proposed under the spectrum of an event study for the first disbursement of the
Ingreso Solidario program, this was made in order to find heterogeneities between groups of
poorer and richer municipalities. The results point to the existence of heterogeneity in the
compliance with isolation measures between the groups analyzed in the study.
